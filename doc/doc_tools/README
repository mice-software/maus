The files "generate_third_party_doc.py" and "generate_MAUS_doc.py" will
generate the doxygen documentation for third party libraries (currently ROOT,
Geant4, CLHEP, and JsonCpp) and MAUS (split up into framework, DataStructure,
Input, Map, Reduce, Output) respectively. Documentations can be browsed via
doc/index.html which is created at the end of "generate_MAUS_doc.py".
If your MAUS installation is set up to use third party libaries from elsewhere
(as given by the environment variable MAUS_THIRD_PARTY), third party
documentation will be stored there. Paths in index.hthml are automatically
adjusted.
THIRD PARTY DOCUMENTATION HAS TO BE GENERATED BEFORE THE MAUS DOCUMENTATION
IN ORDER FOR DERIVED CLASSES TO BE INCLUDED PROPERLY.

NOTE: There is some seemingly invalid LaTeX code in three of the ROOT source
files resulting in the image generation for these equations failing when
creating the ROOT doxygen documentation. The relevant files are in
third_party/build/root_v5.34.07/include/Math and are named
VavilovAccurateCdf.h, VavilovAccuratePdf.h, and VavilovAccurateQuantile.h.
The problematic equation starts on line 53, 51, and 53 respectively. To fix,
replace with the same equation from VavilovAccurate.h line 50-53, specifically
remove the ampersands around the "=" in the first line and replace "\der t" by
"d t" in the third line.

The directories from which the documentation is created are listed below.
(* used to maintain functionality in case of third party library updates.)
