\chapter{Running the Monte Carlo}
\label{chapter:simulation}
The simulation module provides particle generation routines, GEANT4 bindings to track particles through the geometry and routines to convert modelled energy loss in detectors into digitised signals from the MICE DAQ. The Digitisation models are documented under each detector. Here we describe the beam generation and GEANT4 interface.

\section{Beam Generation}
Beam generation is handled by the MapPyBeamMaker module. Beam generation is separated into two classes. The MapPyBeamGenerator has routines to assign particles to a number of individual beam classes, each of which samples particle data from a predefined parent distribution. Beam generation is handled by the \verb|beam| datacard.

The MapPyBeamMaker can either take particles from an external file, overwrite existing particles in the spill, add a specified number of particles from each beam definition, or sample particles from a binomial distribution. The random seed is controlled at the top level and different algorithms can be selected influencing how this is used to generate random seeds on each particle. 

Each beam definition has routines for sampling from a multivariate gaussian distribution or generating ensembles of identical particles (called "pencil" beams here). Additionally it is possible to produce time distributions that are either rectangular or triangular in time to give a simplistic representation of the MICE time distribution.

The beam definition controls are split into four parts. The \verb|reference| branch defines the centroid of the distribution; the \verb|transverse| branch defines the transverse coordinates, $x, y, px, py$; the \verb|longitudinal| branch defines the longitudinal coordinates - time and energy/momentum and the \verb|coupling| branch defines correlations between longitudinal and transverse. Additionally a couple of parameters are available to control random seed generation and relative weighting between different beam definitions.

In transverse, beams are typically sampled from a multivariate gaussian. The Twiss beam ellipse is defined by
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B_\perp} = m \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\epsilon_x \beta_x/p   & -\epsilon_x\alpha_x & 0 & 0 \\
-\epsilon_x\alpha_x & \epsilon_x\gamma_x p  & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0  & \epsilon_y\beta_y/p  & -\epsilon_y\alpha_y \\
0 & 0 & -\epsilon_y\alpha_y & \epsilon_y\gamma_y p \\
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
The Penn beam ellipse is defined by,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B_\perp} = m\epsilon_\perp \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\beta_\perp/p   & -\alpha_\perp & 0 & -\mathcal{L}+\beta_\perp B_0/2p \\
-\alpha_\perp & \gamma_\perp p  & \mathcal{L}-\beta_\perp B_0/2p & 0 \\
0 & \mathcal{L}-\beta_\perp B_0/2p  & \beta_\perp/p  & -\alpha_\perp \\
-\mathcal{L}+\beta_\perp B_0/2p & 0 & -\alpha_\perp & \gamma_\perp p \\
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
where parameters can be controlled in datacards as described below. Note that using the datacards it is possible to define a beam ellipse that is poorly conditioned (determinant nearly zero). In this case MAUS will print an error message like \verb|Warning: invalid value encountered in double_scalars| for each primary.

\subsection{Beam Polarisation}
It is also possible to pass a polarised beam through MAUS. A polarised beam can be generated using the \verb|beam_polarisation| variable on an individual beam parameter. Currently only one polarisation model has been implemented, \verb|gaussian_unit_vectors|. This throws a Gaussian in each of the x, y and z directions and uses this to generate a spin vector. The spin vector is then normalised to 1. Correlations are not implemented.

\subsection{Amplitude Momentum Correlation}
It is possible to introduce artificially a correlation between transverse amplitude (action) and momentum. This can be of use for high emittance beams, such as those in MICE, where the time of flight of high amplitude particles is significantly different to the time of flight of low amplitude particles. The optional \verb|a-p_correlation| dict enables one to specify a correlation $C$ (see table \ref{tab:apcorr}). In this case, the \verb|momentum_variable| $W_o$ is modified according to
\begin{equation}
W_o = W_i(1+CA).
\end{equation}
$W_i$ is the \verb|momentum_variable| as calculated by the longitudinal routines above, $C$ is the correlation magnitude and amplitude $A$ is calculated using
\begin{equation}
A = \mathbf{|V|}^{1/4}m^2(\vec{u^T} \mathbf{V^{-1}} \vec{u}) 
\end{equation}
where $\vec{u}$ is the particle phase space vector, $m$ is the particle mass and $\mathbf{V}$ is the ideal beam matrix defined by the \verb|transverse| dict.

\section{Getting the Right Answer}
In MICE, the code is required to get the right answer for a number of difference use cases. MICE needs accurate stepping through the complex field maps, correct energy loss and scattering in the emittance absorbers and diffuser and accurate energy deposition in the sensitive detectors and correct showering especially in the downstream detectors. The \emph{Right Answer} in this case is the one that agrees with experiment.

\subsection{Geometry}
There are copious comments on setting up your own geometry in the relevant chapter. I only remark here that you should
\begin{itemize}
\item Visualise the geometry.
\item Set \verb|verbose_level| to 1 so that MAUS reports the field configuration in it's output file.
\item Check the field maps using e.g. \verb|bin/examples/make_field_map.py|.
\item Set \verb|check_volume_overlaps| to \verb|True| to call Geant4 internal checks for geometry consistency.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise it is highly unlikely that you will get the correct geometry.

\subsection{Tracking}
The principle tool that can be used to ensure a correct answer from tracking through the field maps is the step size. This is controlled either from MiceModules by setting the G4StepMax parameter per volume; or from
data cards by setting the \verb|max_step_length| parameter. Setting this parameter to a small value increases the tracking time; setting it to a large value decreases the accuracy. Numerically, 100 mm is found to be a reasonable value for sufficiently accurate stepping through the fields [citation: C Rogers thesis]. No one has ever studied effect of miss distance on e.g. some of the MICE apertures.

It is also wise to avoid hard field edge boundaries in the cooling channel. MAUS uses by default 4th order Runge Kutta for numerical integration (RK4, \verb|stepping_algorithm = "ClassicalRK4"|). For each tracking step, RK4 calls the MAUS field map routines 4 times. Geant4/RK4 only knows about the field value at these four points, and makes some smoothing approximation at intermediate points. If the geometry presents a field inhomogeneity i.e. a hard edged boundary, it will severely degrade the stability of the tracking. The way to fix this is to implement Geant4 volume boundaries on either side of the edge of any field maps. This forces Geant4 to stop tracking, step over the field boundary, and then start tracking again.

\subsection{Energy Deposition and Showering}
There are a couple of other considerations for handling energy deposition, decays and so forth. \verb|physics_model| is the master control variable, which tells Geant4 which physics model to use. The Geant4 mindset is that Geant4 provides a library of physics processes, and that the defaults are not necessarily correct for all use cases. This is different to e.g. \verb|MARS| or equivalent tools. Rogers has selected \verb|QGSP_BERT| as a reasonable default, following recommendation from G4Beamline developers.

The MICE beam is quite highly polarised. Polarised decay is possible to do in MAUS (\verb|polarised_decay| and \verb|spin_tracking|), but it is poorly understood experimentally so it is not active by default. Be aware that probably electron background estimation is wrong in MICE/MAUS.

If the physics you wish to study includes showering effects, check that you are happy with the \verb|kinetic_energy_threshold|, \verb|production_threshold| and \verb|fine_grained_production_threshold| parameters. The \verb|kinetic_energy_threshold| sets the minimum energy of particles that will be tracked and the \verb|production_threshold| parameters control the minimum range of particles that will be produced. 

The \verb|fine_grained_production_threshold| sets the geant4 production threshold per particle and per region. Regions are defined using the MiceModule \verb|Region| string property, which can map several volumes to the same region. \verb|fine_grained_production_threshold| should be a dictionary that maps the string name of a region to another dictionary. This dictionary should map the string name or pdg encoded integer id in string format to the production threshold. For example, the entry in the datacards file might look like
\begin{verbatim}
fine_grained_production_threshold = {
    "my_region":{
       "e+":0.1,
       "11":0.01,
       "22":-1
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
which would set production thresholds for all MiceModules in \verb|my_region| to 0.1 mm for positrons, 0.01 mm for electrons, and use the Geant4 defaults for gammas. All other particles would take their production threshold defaults from \verb|production_threshold| datacard.

\section{GEANT4 Bindings}
The GEANT4 bindings are encoded in the Simulation module. GEANT4 groups particles by run, event and track. A GEANT4 run maps to a MICE spill; a GEANT4 event maps to a single inbound particle from the beamline; and a GEANT4 track corresponds to a single particle in the experiment.

A number of classes are provided for basic initialisation of GEANT4.

\begin{itemize}
\item MAUSGeant4Manager: is responsible for handling interface to GEANT4. MAUSGeant4Manager handles initialisation of the GEANT4 bindings as well as accessors for individual GEANT4 objects (see below). Interfaces are provided to run one or many particles through the geometry, returning the relevant event data. The MAUSGeant4Manager sets and clears the event action before each run.
\item MAUSPhysicsList: contains routines to set up the GEANT4 physical processes. Datacards settings are provided to disable stochastic processes or all processes and set a few parameters. In the end, the physics list set up gets called by the FieldPhaser.
\item FieldPhaser: the field phaser is a MAUS-specific tool for automatically phasing fields, for example RF cavities, such that they ramp coincidentally with incoming particles. The FieldPhaser contains routines to fire test ("reference") particles through the accelerator lattice and phase fields appropriately. The FieldPhaser phasing routines are called after GEANT4 is first initialised.
\item DetectorConstruction: the DetectorConstruction routines provide an interface between the MAUS internal geometry representation encoded in MiceModules and GEANT4. DetectorConstruction is responsible for calling the relevant routines for setting up the general engineering geometry, calling detector-specific geometry set-up routines and calling the field map set-up routines.
\item VirtualPlanes: the VirtualPlanes routines are designed to extract particle data from the GEANT4 tracking independently of the GEANT4 geometry. The VirtualPlanes routines watches for steps that step across some plane in physical space, or some time, or some proper time, and then interpolates from the step ends to the plane in question.
\item FillMaterials: (legacy) the FillMaterials routines are used to initialise a number of specific 
\item MAUSVisManager the MAUSVisManager is responsible for handling interfaces with the GEANT4 visualisation.
\end{itemize}

The GEANT4 \emph{Action} objects provide interfaces for MAUS-specific function calls at certain points in the tracking.

\begin{itemize}
\item MAUSRunAction: sets up the running for a particular spill. In MAUS, it just reinitialises the visualisation.
\item MAUSEventAction: sets up the running for a particular inbound particle. At the beginning of each event, the virtual planes, tracking, detectors and stepping are all cleared. After the event the event data is pulled into the event data from each element.
\item MAUSTrackingAction: is called when a new track is created or destroyed. If \verb|keep_tracks| datacard is set to True, on particle creation, MAUSTrackingAction writes the initial and final track position and momentum to the output data tree. If \verb|keep_steps| is set to True MAUSTrackingAction gets step data from MAUSSteppingAction and writes this also.
\item MAUSSteppingAction: is called at each step of the particle. If \verb|keep_steps| datacard is set to True, output step data is recorded. MAUSSteppingAction kills particles if they exceed the \verb|maximum_number_of_steps| datacard. MAUSSteppingAction calls the VirtualPlanes routines on each step.
\item MAUSStackingAction: is called when a new track is created, prioritising particle tracking. Handles killing particles based on the \verb|kinetic_energy_threshold|, \verb|default_keep_or_kill| and \verb|keep_or_kill_particles| datacards.
\item MAUSPrimaryGeneratorAction: is called at the start of every event and sets the particle data for each event. In MAUS, this particle generation is handled externally and so the MAUSPrimaryGeneratorAction role is to look for the primary object on the Monte Carlo event and convert this into a GEANT4 event object.
