\chapter{Field Properties}
Invoke a field using PropertyString FieldType {\textless}fieldtype{\textgreater}. The field will be placed, normally
centred on the MiceModule Position and with the appropriate Rotation. Further options for each field type are specified
below, and relevant datacards are also given. If a fieldtype is specified some other properties must also be specified,
while others may be optional, usually taking their value from defaults specified in the datacards. Only one fieldtype
can be specified per module. However, fields from multiple modules are superimposed, each transformed according to the
MiceModule specification. This enables many different field configurations to be simulated using MAUS.

To use BeamTools fields, datacard FieldMode Full must be set. This is the default.

\subsection{FieldType Solenoid}
MAUS simulates solenoids using a series of current sheets. The field for each solenoid is written to a field map on a
rectangular grid and can then be reused. The field from each current sheet is calculated using the formula for current
sheets detailed in MUCOOL Note 281, \textit{Modeling solenoids using coil, sheet and block conductors}.

\end{supertabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{FieldType FieldAmalgamation}
During tracking, MAUS stores a list of fields and for each one MAUS checks to see if tracking is performed through a
particular field map's bounding box. This can be slow if a large number of fields are present. One way to speed this up
is to store contributions from many coils in a single CoilAmalgamation. A CoilAmalgamation searches through child
modules for solenoids with PropertyBool IsAmalgamated set to true. If it finds such a coil, it will add the field
generated by the solenoid to its own field map and disable the coil.

\subsection{FieldType DerivativesSolenoid}
This is an alternative field model for solenoids that uses a power law expansion of the on-axis magnetic field and its
derivatives, and an exponential fall-off for the fringe field. The fringe field is defined in the same way as other end
fields, but note that HardEdged end field type is not available for solenoids and will result in an error.

\subsection{Phasing Models}
MAUS has a number of sophisticated models for phasing RF cavities. These powerful models can make setting up RF
cavities with realistic fields both quick and easy.

When CavityMode is Unphased, MAUS attempts to phase the cavity itself. When using CavityMode Unphased MAUS needs to
know when particles enter, cross the middle, and leave cavities. This means that:

\liststyleLxiii
\begin{itemize}
\item The cavity must sit in a rectangular or cylindrical physical volume.
\item No other physical volumes may overlap or sit within the physical volume of the cavity.
\end{itemize}
If these conditions are not met the phasing algorithm is likely to fail.

To phase a cavity, MAUS builds a volume in the centre of the cavity that is used for phasing and then fires a
reference particle through the system. Stochastic processes are always disabled during this process, while mean energy
loss can be disabled using the datacard ReferenceEnergyLossModel. If a reference particle crosses a plane through the
centre of a cavity, it sets the phase of the cavity to the time at which the particle crosses. 

The field of the cavity during phasing is controlled by the property FieldDuringPhasing. There are four modes:

\liststyleLxiv
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{None}: Cavity fields are disabled during phasing
\item \textit{Electrostatic}: An electrostatic field with no positional dependence given by
PeakEField*sin(ReferenceParticlePhase) is enabled during phasing.
\item \textit{TimeVarying}: A standard time varying field is applied during phasing, initially with arbitrary phase
relative to the reference particle. MAUS uses a Newton-Raphson method to find the appropriate reference phase
iteratively, with tolerance set by the datacard PhaseTolerance.
\item \textit{EnergyGainOptimised}: A standard time varying field is applied during phasing, initially with arbitrary
phase and peak field relative to the reference particle. MAUS uses a 2D Newton-Raphson method to find the appropriate
reference phase and peak field iteratively, so that the reference particle crosses the cavity centre with phase given
by property ReferenceParticlePhase and gains energy over the whole cavity given by property EnergyGain with tolerances
set by the datacards PhaseTolerance and RFDeltaEnergyTolerance.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Tracking Stability Around RF Cavities}
Usually RF cavities have little or no fringe field, and this can lead to some instability in the tracking algorithms.
When MAUS makes a step into an RF cavity volume, the tracking algorithms tend to smooth out a field in a non-physical
way. This can be prevented by either (i) making the step size rather small in the RF cavity or (ii) forcing MAUS to
stop tracking by adding a physical volume at the entrance of the RF cavity (a window, typically made of vacuum). Doing
this should improve stability of tracking.

\subsection{FieldType PillBox}
Sets a PillBox field in a particular region. MAUS represents pillboxes using a sinusoidally varying TM010 pill box
field, with non-zero field vector elements given by

\begin{equation*}
\begin{gathered}B_{\phi }=J_1(k_rr)\cos (\omega t)\\E_z=J_0(k_rr)\cos (\omega t)\end{gathered}
\end{equation*}
Here J\textsubscript{n} are Bessel functions and k\textsubscript{r} is a constant. See, for example, SY Lee VI.1. All
other fields are 0.

\subsection{FieldType Multipole}
Creates a multipole of arbitrary order. Fields are generated using either a hard edged model, with no fringe fields at
all; or an Enge model similar to ZGoubi and COSY. In the former case fields are calculated using a simple polynomial
expansion. In the latter case fields are calculated using the polynomial expansion with an additional exponential drop
off. Fields can be superimposed onto a bent coordinate system to generate a sector multipole with arbitrary fixed
radius of curvature.

Unlike most other field models in MAUS, the zero position corresponds to the center of the entrance of the multipole;
and the multipole extends in the +z direction.

The method to define end fields is described in the section EndFieldTypes below

\subsection{FieldType CombinedFunction}
This creates superimposed dipole, quadrupole and sextupole fields with a common radius of curvature. The field is
intended to mimic the first few terms in a multipole expansion of a field like

\begin{equation*}
B(y=0)=B_0\left(\frac r{r_0}\right)^k
\end{equation*}
The field index is a user defined parameter, while the dipole field and radius of curvature can either be defined
directly by the user or defined in terms of a reference momentum and total bending angle. Fields are calculated as in
the multipole field type defined above.

\subsection{EndFieldTypes}
In the absence of current sources, the magnetic field can be calculated from a scalar potential using the standard
relation

\begin{equation*}
\vec B=\nabla V_n
\end{equation*}
The scalar magnetic potential of the n\textsuperscript{th}{}-order multipole field is given by

\begin{equation*}
V_n=\sum _{q=0}^{q_m}\sum _{m=0}^nn!^2\frac{G^{(2q)}(s)(r^2+y^2)^q\sin (\frac{m\pi } 2)r^{n-m}y^m}{4^qq!(n+q)!m!(n-m)!}
\end{equation*}
where \textit{G(s)} is either the double Enge function,

\begin{equation*}
G(s)=E[(x-x_0)/\lambda ]+E[(-x-x_0)/\lambda ]-1
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
E(s)=\frac{B_0}{R_0^n}\frac 1{1+\exp (C_1+C_2s+C_3s^2+...)}
\end{equation*}
or G(s) is the double tanh function,

\begin{equation*}
G(s)=\tanh [(x+x_0)/\lambda ]/2+\tanh [(x-x_0)/\lambda ]/2
\end{equation*}
and \textit{(r, y, s)} is the position vector in the rotating coordinate system. Note that here s is the distance from
the nominal end of the field map.

\subsection{FieldType MagneticFieldMap}
Reads or writes a magnetic field map in a particular region. Two sorts of field maps are supported; either a 2d field
map, in which cylindrical symmetry is assumed, or a 3d field map. 

For 2d field maps, MAUS reads or writes a file that contains information about the radial and longitudinal field
components. This is intended for solenoidal field maps where only radial and longitudinal field components are present.
Note that in write mode, MAUS assumes cylindrical symmetry of the fields. In this case, MAUS writes the \textit{x}
and \textit{z} components of the magnetic field at points on a grid in \textit{x} and \textit{z}. Fields with an
electric component are excluded from this summation.

For 3d field maps, MAUS reads a file that contains the position and field in cartesian coordinates and performs a
linear interpolation. This requires quite large field map files; the file size can be slightly reduced by using certain
symmetries, as described below. It is currently not possible to write 3d field maps.

Some file formats are described below. I am working towards making the file format more generic and hence possibly
easier to use, but backwards compatibility will hopefully be maintained. 

\subsubsection{MAUStext Field Map Format}
The native field map format used by MAUS in text mode is described below.

{\ttfamily
\# GridType = Uniform N = \textbf{number\_rows}}

{\ttfamily
\# Z1 = \textbf{z\_start} Z2 = \textbf{z\_end} dZ = \textbf{z\_step}}

{\ttfamily
\# R1 = \textbf{r\_start} R2 = \textbf{r\_end} dR = \textbf{r\_step}}

{\ttfamily\bfseries
Bz\_Values\ \ Br\_Values}

{\ttfamily\bfseries
...\ \ \ \ ...}

{\ttfamily\bfseries
{\textless}Repeat as necessary{\textgreater}}

In this mode, field maps are represented by field values on a regular 2d grid that is assumed to have solenoidal
symmetry, i.e. cylindrical symmetry with no tangential component.

\subsubsection{g4bl3dGrid Field Map Format}
The file format for 3d field maps is a slightly massaged version of a file format used by another code, g4beamline. In
this mode, field maps are represented by field values on a regular cartesian 3d grid.

{\ttfamily\bfseries
number\_x\_points number\_y\_points number\_z\_points global\_scale}

{\ttfamily
1 X [\textbf{x\_scale}]}

{\ttfamily
2 Y [\textbf{y\_scale}]}

{\ttfamily
3 Z [\textbf{z\_scale}]}

{\ttfamily
4 BX [\textbf{bx\_scale}]}

{\ttfamily
5 BY [\textbf{by\_scale}]}

{\ttfamily
6 BZ [\textbf{bz\_scale}]}

{\ttfamily
0}

{\ttfamily\bfseries
X\_Values \ \ Y\_Values\ \ Z\_Values\ \ Bx\_values\ \ By\_values\ \ Bz\_values}

{\ttfamily\bfseries
...\ \ \ \ ...\ \ \ \ ...\ \ \ \ ...\ \ \ \ ...\ \ \ \ ...}

{\ttfamily\bfseries
{\textless}Repeat as necessary{\textgreater}}
