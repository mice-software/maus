\section{What Who and How?}
MAUS (MICE Analysis User Software) is the MICE project's tracking, detector reconstruction and accelerator physics analysis framework. MAUS is designed to fulfil a number of functions for physicists interested in studying MICE data:

\begin{itemize}
\item Model the behaviour of particles traversing MICE
\item Model the MICE detector's electronics response to particles
\item Perform pattern recognition to reconstruct particle trajectories from electronics output
\item Provide a framework for high level accelerator physics analysis
\item Provide online diagnostics during running of MICE
\end{itemize}

In addition to MAUS's role within MICE, the code is also used for generic accelerator development, in particular for the Neutrino Factory.

\subsection{Who Should Use MAUS}
MAUS is intended to be used by physicists interested in studying the MICE data. MAUS is designed to function as a general tool for modelling particle accelerators and associated detector systems. The modular system, described in the API section, makes MAUS suitable for use by any accelerator or detector group wishing to perform simulation or reconstruction work.

\subsection{Getting the Code and Installing MAUS}
Installation is described in a separate document, available at \url{http://micewww.pp.rl.ac.uk/projects/maus/wiki/Install}

\section{Running MAUS}
MAUS contains several applications to perform various tasks. Two main applications are provided. \verb|bin/simulate_mice.py| makes a Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment and \verb|bin/analyze_data_offline.py| reconstructs an existing data file. The applications can be run simply by calling from the command line
\begin{verbatim}
 > ${MAUS_ROOT_DIR}/bin/simulate_mice.py
 > ${MAUS_ROOT_DIR}/bin/analyze_data_offline.py
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Run Control}
The routines can be controlled by a number of settings that enable users to specify run configurations, as specified in this document. Most control variables can be controlled directly from the comamnd line, for example doing
\begin{verbatim}
 > ${MAUS_ROOT_DIR}/bin/simulate_mice.py -simulation_geometry_filename Test.dat
\end{verbatim}
To get a (long) list of all command line variables use the \verb|-h| switch.
\begin{verbatim}
 > ${MAUS_ROOT_DIR}/bin/simulate_mice.py -h
\end{verbatim}

More complex control variables can be controlled using a configuration file, which contains a list of configuration options.
\begin{verbatim}
 > ${MAUS_ROOT_DIR}/bin/simulate_mice.py -configuration_file config.py
\end{verbatim}
where a sample configuration file for the example above might look like
\begin{verbatim}
simulation_geometry_filename = "Test.dat"
\end{verbatim}
Note that where on the command line a tag like \verb|-variable value| was used, in the configuration file \verb|variable = "value"| is used. In fact the configuration file is a python script. When loaded, MAUS looks for variables in it's variable list and loads them in as configuration options. Other variables are ignored. This gives users the full power of a scripting language while setting up run configurations. For example, one might choose to use a different filename,
\begin{verbatim}
import os
simulation_geometry_filename = os.path.join(
                          os.environ["MICEFILES"]
                          "Models/Configurations/Test.dat"
)
\end{verbatim}
This configuration will then load the file at \verb|$MICEFILES/Models/Configurations/Test.dat|

The default configuration file can be found at \verb|src/common_py/ConfigurationDefaults.py| which contains a list of all possible configuration variables and is loaded by default by MAUS. Any variables not specified by the user are taken from the configuration defaults.
