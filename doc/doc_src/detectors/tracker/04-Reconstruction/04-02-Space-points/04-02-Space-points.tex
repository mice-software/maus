\subsection{Space-point reconstruction}
\label{Sect:SciFiSpcPnt}

This section describes the space-point reconstruction, the algebra by which the cluster positions are translated in to tracker coordinates and, to some extent, the algorithm.

\subsubsection{Selection of clusters that form the space-point}

For each particle event, the clusters found within each doublet layer are ordered by fibre-channel number. Taking each station in turn, an attempt is made to generate a space point using all possible combinations of clusters. The three clusters, one each from views $u$, $v$ and $w$, that make up a space point satisfy:

\begin{equation}
 n^u + n^v + n^w = n^u_0 + n^v_0 + n^w_0 \, ;
\end{equation}
where $n^u$, $n^v$ and $n^w$ are the fibre numbers of the clusters in the $u$, $v$ and $w$ views respectively and $n^u_0$, $n^v_0$ and $n^w_0$ are the respective central-fibre numbers (see Appendix~\ref{App:SciFiKuno}).

A triplet space point is selected if:

\begin{equation}
  | (n^u + n^v + n^w) - (n^u_0 + n^v_0 + n^w_0) | < K \, .
\end{equation}
Once all triplet space-points have been found, doublet space-points are created from pairs of clusters from different views.

\subsubsection{Crossing-position calculation}

\paragraph{Doublet space-points}
\label{Para:DoubletSpacepoint}

The position of the doublet space-point in station coordinates, ${\bf r}_s$, is given by:

\begin{eqnarray}
  {\bf r}_s & = & \left( 
                      \begin{array}{c}
                        x_s \\ y_s
                      \end{array}
                     \right)                                  \\
               & = & \underline{\underline{R}}_{SD1} {\bf m}_1 
                                              \label{Eq:DSP1} \\
               & = & \underline{\underline{R}}_{SD2} {\bf m}_2 
                                              \label{Eq:DSP2} \, ;
\end{eqnarray}
where the measurement vector corresponding to the $i^{\rm th}$ cluster: 

\begin{equation}
  {\bf m}_i = \left( 
               \begin{array}{c}
                 \alpha_i \\ \beta_i
               \end{array}
              \right) \, ;
\end{equation}
and the rotation matrix $\underline{\underline{R}}_{SDi}$ are defined in section~\ref{SubSect:SciFiHtsClstrs}. The simultaneous equations~\ref{Eq:DSP1} and \ref{Eq:DSP2} contain two unknowns, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. Equations~\ref{Eq:DSP1} and \ref{Eq:DSP2} may be rewritten:

\begin{equation}
  {\bf m}_1 = \underline{\underline{R}}_{SD1}^{-1}
              \underline{\underline{R}}_{SD2} {\bf m}_2 \, .
\end{equation}
Defining:

\begin{eqnarray}
  \underline{\underline{S}} & = & \underline{\underline{R}}_{SD1}^{-1}
                                  \underline{\underline{R}}_{SD2}     \\
                            & = & \left( 
                                    \begin{array}{cc}
                                      s_{11} & s_{12} \\
                                      s_{21} & s_{22}
                                    \end{array}
                                   \right) \, ;
\end{eqnarray}
Equations \ref{Eq:DSP1} and \ref{Eq:DSP2} may be solved to yield:

\begin{eqnarray}
  \beta_2 & = & \frac{\alpha_1 - s_{11} \alpha_2}{s_{12}}     \\
  \beta_1 & = & s_{21} \alpha_2 + s_{22} \beta_2 \, .
\end{eqnarray}
The position of the space-point may now be obtained from equation~\ref{Eq:DSP1} or \ref{Eq:DSP2}.

\paragraph{Triplet space-points}

As shown in figure~\ref{Fig:SenseArea}, the fibres layout is of one of two types. In one case (right panel of figure~\ref{Fig:SenseArea}), the centre of the channels, one in each of the three views, cross intersect at a single point. In this case, the position of the crossing can be calculated as described in section~\ref{Para:DoubletSpacepoint}. When the area of overlap of the three channels forms a triangle (figure~\ref{Fig:SenseArea} left panel), the centre of area of overlap is given by:

\begin{eqnarray}
  \bar{x} & = & \frac{2}{3}c_p \, {\rm ; and}       \\
  \bar{y} & = & 0 \, .
\end{eqnarray}
