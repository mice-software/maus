\subsection{Labelling of upstream and downstream trackers}
\label{SubSect:TkrLabel}

The labels for two trackers are: 
\begin{eqnarray}
  {\rm Upstream~tracker}   & \rightarrow & {\rm Tracker \# 1} \nonumber \\
  {\rm Downstream~tracker} & \rightarrow & {\rm Tracker \# 2} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Station numbering}
\label{SubSect:StnNumbering}

The tracker reference document defines the station ``labelling'' of the
stations in relation to the focus-coil module that is immediately
downstream of tracker 1 or, equivalently, immediately upstream of
tracker 2. 
The station closest to the focus-coil module in question is labelled 
``1''.
