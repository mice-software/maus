Please add comments in run()'s docstring that explains what the macro does.  This will help other people who want to use your code.  Here is an example:

def run(number_of_events):
    """Simulate the MICE experiment

    This will simulate 'number_of_events' MICE events through the entirity
    of MICE using Geant4.  At present, TOF and Tracker hits will be digitized.
    """
