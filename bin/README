bin directory contains user executables for driving MAUS components. These
executables are intended in the first instance to be used to model MAUS, but 
additionally are expected to form examples on which users can build their own
physics simulations and analyses.

Directory contents:

simulate_mice.py: simulation, digitisation and reconstruction of the MICE 
                  experiment.
analyze_data_offline.py: unpacking of experimental data, digitisation and
                  reconstruction of the MICE experiment

Subdirectories:

examples: tutorial and example code to help users to build their own
          applications; usually focussing on a particular part of the workflow.
utilities: utility functions that sit outside of the normal workflow; for
           example, utilities to browse output data files, etc.
user: temporary user applications that don't follow the usual style requirements
