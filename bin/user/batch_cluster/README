August 2016

The code in this directory is for use on a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) batch system,
having been designed and tested on the Imperial College HEP batch cluster by
C. Hunt and adapted for inclusion in MAUS by A. Dobbs.

The code runs a large number of MAUS simulations in order to evaluate the
performance of the tracker software, particularly the Kalman filter. Scripts to 
analyse the resulting data are also present.

Description:

The following top level directories are present:

* beams - to contain pre-generated MICE beams for use in the simulations
* datacards - MAUS configuration files used by the simulations
* geometry - a few simple geometries used by the simulations
* output - the output from the simulation, analysis, and all the messages
           returned by the SGE
* scripts - the scripts used to launch the batch jobs, run the simulations, 
            analyse the output and create the plots

Instructions:

* source env.sh in a MAUS installation capable of running on the batch nodes
* Link pre-generated beam files into the beams directory:
** Download the beam data:
*** Move to the beams directory and create a directory called test_beams
*** In this directory download the beam data: 
    wget http://heplnv152.pp.rl.ac.uk/maus/beams/uniform_momentum_zero_position.tar.gz
*** Untar the tarball
** Alternatively, Imperial lx cluster users can just create the following soft
   link in the beams directory:
   ln -s /vols/mice/mice-data/maus-beams/test_beams test_beams
** The paths and data files used are listed in the datacards:
   beams/test_beams/uniform_momentum_zero_position/uniform_2000_XXX.dat
   or beams/test_beams/uniform_momentum_zero_position/uniform_1000_XXX.dat,
   where XXX is in the range 000 - 999 (should all work by default).
* Run scripts/execute_all_simulations.sh and wait for the jobs to finish
* Check the output ROOT files are present under the output/simulation directory
* Run scripts/analysis/analyse_all.sh
* Check the output ROOT files are present under the output/analysis directory
* Run scripts/analysis/make_plots.sh
* Check the output pdf files are present under the output/analysis/plots directory

Notes:

* The status of batch jobs can be checked with the qstat command
* The messages from the batch system are stored in output/batch_messages
* The plots used in the tracker software paper are generated in the folder
  resolution_reqCluster_helix_complete in the plots directory
