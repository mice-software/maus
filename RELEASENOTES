  The following third party libraries need to be rerun:
    - third_party/bash/40python_extras.bash
    - third_party/bash/51xboas.bash
    - third_party/bash/53unpacking.bash

MAUS-v0.1.0
  The following functionality was added:
    - Functionality to import geometries direct from GDML files into GEANT4 added

MAUS-v0.0.9
  The following functionality was added:
    - TOF reconstruction to space points added
    - Controls for geant4 physics processes added
    - Generalised histogramming functionality for online data quality added
    - Skeleton documentation outline added
    - Tracker geant4 modelling code was added
    - Tracker digitization code was added
    - TOF digitization code was removed as it did not meet required quality checks
  The following third party libraries need to be rerun:

MAUS-v0.0.8
  - Merged DAQ unpacking code
  - Refactor of execution framework to prepare for multiprocessing and online
    reconstruction
  - Documentation skeleton introduced
  - Executable (bin/utilities/json_browser.py) to browse formatted json output in
    more human readable form 

MAUS-v0.0.7
  - New functions to generate input beam
    -- Multivariate gaussian in x, px, y, py, time, energy
    -- Additionally sawtooth or uniform distribution in time
    -- Either fixed number of particles or selected from binomial distribution per spill
    -- Multiple distributions can be generated with difference particle types, etc
  - simulate_mice run control is now entirely through datacards
    -- Number of spills input and output filenames can all be selected in datacards
  - datacards can be specified on the command line or in an external file
    -- -configuration_file <file> specifies the python file to use for datacards

MAUS-v0.0.6
  - Added calls to geant4 inline visualisation

MAUS-v0.0.5
  - Added some new compile flags to control C++ optimisation, profiling, debugging, code coverage
