"""
SConscript file controls the MAUS build

Call this build script by doing (with third party libraries built)
    source env.sh
    scons
scons has a good man entry. A few useful switches are
    - scons -c cleanup (delete built files)
    - scons -s silent (gcc errors and warnings only)
    - scons -j2 multiprocess with e.g. 2 cores

SConscript file replaces the standard makefile for the MAUS library. SConscript
uses scons library to handle builds. We have three submodules
- environment_tools contains tools for modifying the environment
- module_builder contains tools for handling modules (input, output, map, 
  reduce) 
- core_builder contains tools for handling the MAUS core (common_cpp, common_py,
  legacy)
