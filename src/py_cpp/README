NOTE

Everything in this directory prefixed by Py will be built into a shared object.
So PyMyCode.hh and PyMyCode.cc will be built into a shared object like
mycode.so, and it is assumed that these codes will have a python import function
somewhere inside, like initmycode(). See the existing examples.
