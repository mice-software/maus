NOTE

Everything in this directory prefixed by Py will be built into a shared object.
So PyMyCode.hh and PyMyCode.cc will be built into a shared object like
mycode.so, and it is assumed that these codes will have a python import function
somewhere inside, like initmycode(). See the existing examples.

When you do, inside python,

import mycode

Python looks for  a file like mycode.py (python) or mycode.so (C++). If it finds 
mycode.so it looks for a symbol called initmycode() that will instantiate the 
module. It is an ImportError exception if Python fails to do this.

The build scripts are set up to build the classes here and make files like
mycode.so, but it is up to the developer to make sure that the initmycode 
function exists.
