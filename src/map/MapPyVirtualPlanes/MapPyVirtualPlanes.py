## Virtual planes show when a particle crossed a z-plane
#
#  @class MapPyVirtualPlanes.MapPyVirtualPlanes
#  This class saves the state vector of a muon that crosses some imaginary plane
#  in (x,y) where the beam axis is 'z'.  This class is meant to be comparable to
#  the G4MICE VirtualPlanes application.  One *could* use tracks to do the same
#  thing, but this processor tries to do the reduction of tracks such that not
#  much room is used on the disk.
