    This class is used to chain maps together.  For example, if one
    wants to simulate a spill then fit the spill then create some
    accelerator physics quantity, one has to chain various maps
    together. Or mathematically, if you have some function/operation
    f(x), g(x), and h(x) on some spill called 's'.  Then this allows
    the composition f(g(h(s))).
