## @class MapPyRemoveTracks.MapPyRemoveTracks
#  MapPyRemoveTracks removes tracks
#
#  Can either removes the all of the spill["tracks"]
#  portions of the spill or just non-muon tracks.
#  The tracks can take up significant amounts of space,
#  so this is a good idea. Or you can just tell the
#  MapCppSimulation() not to create tracks by adding the
#  following datacard when calling Go():
#
#      keep_only_muon_tracks = False
