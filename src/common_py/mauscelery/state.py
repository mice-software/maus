    MAUS transform configuration consisting of a MAUS JSON
    configuration document, a transform specification an ID and the
    current MAUS version. The transform specification can be a single
    name - representing a single transform - or a list of transforms -
    representing a MapPyGroup. Sub-lists are treated as nested
    MapPyGroups. For example: 
    @verbatim

    It is assumed that transform specification consists of valid
    transform names and that configuration is a valid JSON
    document. Callers can ensure this via calls to
    WorkerUtilities.validate_transform or json.dumps.
    This serves as a container for configuration for both the Celery
    master and sub-processes.
