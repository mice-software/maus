    Execute merge-output MAUS dataflows reading spills from a document

    an output stream:

      IF spill IS "end_of_run" 
        end_of_run = spill
      IF spill_run_number != run_number
        IF is_birthed

    DEATH merger and outputter

    This assumes that all spills for run N-1 have time stamps less
    than that of spills for run N.

    is_birthed is used to ensure that there is no BIRTH-DEATH-BIRTH
    redundancy on receipt of the first spill. 

    If a document store is not given to the constructor then this
    class expects a document store class to be specified in the JSON
    configuration e.g.  
    @verbatim
    doc_store_class = "MongoDBDocumentStore.MongoDBDocumentStore"
    @endverbatim
    The document store class itself may have additional configuration
    requirements.  

    If a collection name is given to the constructor then this is
    used. Otherwise there must be a doc_collection_name key in the
    configuration.
