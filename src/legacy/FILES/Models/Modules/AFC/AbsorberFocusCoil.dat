// WARNING *** I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL TO GET THIS RIGHT
//         *** JUST DONT BREAK IT!
//
// I think I fixed the AFC module, which was a complete mess.
//
// The curvature shape came from communication with Wing about 3 years ago. I hope it's still correct. 
//
// The tests I did to make sure the new geometry was reasonable:
//
// (i) I ran with datacard 
// CheckVolumeOverlaps 1
// This uses GEANT4 internal routine to check for overlaps between different GEANT4 volumes.
// 
// (ii) I plotted energy deposited vs (z,r) for different emittance samples and checked that they lose energy where I expect and don't lose energy where I don't expect.
// 
// (iii) I made some visualisations and checked it looks reasonable. Copper is red, Aluminium is white, lH2 is blue.
// 
// (iv) I plotted the energy on axis vs z for a reference particle (no stochastics) and checked it looked reasonable.
// 
// Notes:
// - I don't implement the Mylar bullet proofing.
// - I do not take responsibility for maintaining this geometry file.
