/** @class ObjectProcessor processes json object types into C++ classes
 *
 *  The object processor converts from a C++ class to a json value and vice
 *  versa. Member data can be stored as items of the json object. Members are
 *  registered using the RegisterPointerBranch and RegisterValueBranch methods
 *  and these are accessed by the JsonToCpp and CppToJson conversion methods.
 *  The relevant Processor, together with C++ accessors and mutators have to be
 *  stored along with the Branch.
 *
 *  This works by storing the registered branches in a std::vector of BaseItems.
 *  The BaseItem defines an interface for allocating and accessing member data
 *  for the branch based on the registered processor, accessor and mutator.
 *  BaseItem has been overloaded with four specific ways to register a branch,
 *  \li RegisterPointerBranch for pointer data type where the ObjectType object
 *      owns the memory
 *  \li RegisterPointerReference for pointer data type where another C++ object
 *      in the tree owns the memory (borrowed reference)
 *  \li RegisterValueBranch for value data
 *  \li RegisterConstantBranch for static const data
 *
 *  @tparam ObjectType C++ type that will be converted
