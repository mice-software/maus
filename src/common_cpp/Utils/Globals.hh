/** @class Globals - Handler for global objects.
 *
 *  The Globals holds data associated with a particular execution of the
 *  MAUS code. The Globals is a singleton class. Note that in distributed
 *  computing mode there will be one MAUSProcess per processing node.
 *
 *  This is quite a low level object, so it just hands pointers around. For 
 *  example don't want to require GEANT4 or anything to interact with this class
 *  and don't want to risk circular dependencies. For this reason instantiation
 *  is handled by GlobalsManager class, which is high level and does need
 *  to know about all that stuff. Also has destructor there. I would rather keep
 *  construction and destruction in the class, but I think it makes circular
 *  references which can be unpleasant.
 *
 *  Note also that one feature is that (except GEANT4, which won't fix) it would
 *  be nice if we take out all of the global/static variables and initialise
 *  things here instead. So that we can in principle do a delete and
 *  reinitialise and get a completely clean set up. This is not completely fixed
 *  yet - next thing is to remove src/legacy/MICERun.hh and fix everything that
 *  breaks
