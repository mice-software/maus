/** @class MAUS::DataStructure::Global::TrackPoint
 *  @ingroup globalrecon
 *  @brief TrackPoint object for the global reconstruction.
 *  @author Ian Taylor, University of Warwick
 *  @date 2013/03/01
 *
 *  A reconstructed track point, produced by the global
 *  reconstruction.  It represents a single point in space through
 *  which the reconstruction has determined the
 *  MAUS::DataStructure::Global::Track passed, defined by a position and
 *  momentum measurement, with associated errors.

 *  Most TrackPoints will correspond to a detector measurement (with a
 *  MAUS::DataStructure::Global::SpacePoint object), but some will be virtual
 *  (MAUS::DataStructure::Global::DetectorPoint kVirtual), matching a
 *  projected point.
