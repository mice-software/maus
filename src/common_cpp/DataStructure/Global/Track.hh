/** @class MAUS::DataStructure::Global::Track
 *  @ingroup globalrecon
 *  @brief Track object for the global reconstruction.
 *  @author Ian Taylor, University of Warwick
 *  @date 2013/03/01
 *
 *  A reconstructed track, produced by the global reconstruction.
 *  Primarily consists of a series of
 *  MAUS::DataStructure::Global::TrackPoint's, as well as the PID/charge
 *  assumption underwhich the track was reconstructed.  Constituent
 *  tracks can be stored, for book-keeping purposes.
