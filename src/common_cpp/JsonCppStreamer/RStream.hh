 *
 * This is the abstract base class for root file streaming. It defines some common
 * functionality at this abstract level. Such functionality includes checking 
 * is a file is open. Initialising a root file and attaching externally defined
 * variables/objects to branches. It also stores a collection of pointers to 
 * branch variables. This is necessary as when using root trees, pointers to 
 * variables may not go out of scope and be destroyed.
