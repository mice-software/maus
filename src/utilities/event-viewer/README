*** MICE off-line Event Viewer comes in two flavours: EVSimpleExporter (command line application) and EventViewer (GUI application). They share many features but also have specific functionalities


*** EVSimpleExporter is a command line mode for MICE Event Viewer. It is designed to export events from selected spills to heprep format files which can then be viewed using HepRApp java app. HepRApp can display detector geometry along with MICE data and features multiple views.

 Event selection is available in EVSimpleExporter by passing proper command line arguments. 
 For usage and full set of options type ./EVSimpleExporter -h.

 (for following steps make sure MAUS environment is set first)
 To build EVSimpleExporter type: make -f Makefile.simple 
 To build clean EVSimpleExporter type: make -f Makefile.simple clean

 IMPORTANT: Before running EVSimpleExporter be sure to edit and modify configure.sh to set some necessary environmental variables.

 (*)To run HepRapp app you will need Java runtime environment on your computer. Suggested one is jre1.6.0_33 and it can be downloaded from:

 You can customize various HepRApp options editing user.properties file in your working directory. Here example user.properties is provided 


*** EventViewer is a GUI application. It displays MICE events in two planes in detector coordinate system. Detector geometry representation is not available. However, option to export and even display desired events in heprep format is supported.

 To build and run EventViewer you need to have MAUS framework and QT installed.
 
 To build EventViewer first edit EventViewer.pro and set MAUS_DIR to your local MAUS installation (this is maybe not required for first 
 build). Source MAUS, type qmake and then make.

If you want to display event in HepRApp follow installation steps above (*).
