These tests are for the 'core' of MAUS or the library area of 'commonCpp'. These are not for input/map/reduce/output workers since those unit tests are stored in their respective source directory then installed into 'build' like everything else.

These tests are built by running 'scons' in the MAUS_ROOT_DIR.  They are run by either directly calling them with python:

 python test_something.py

or to discover and run all tests run:

 python -m unittest discover -b -v build 

in $MAUS_ROOT_DIR.
